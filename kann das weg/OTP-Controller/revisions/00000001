Common crypto software runs on systems with an OS. Our approach is to reduce the attack surface of an operating system with its user programs by delegating the crypto part to an system as simple as possible.

System scetch:

An AVR controller with keyboard and display is used to gather the plain text which is held only in the controllers RAM. An One Time Pad encryption is performed using an large keyfile stored on the SDCARD attached to the AVR.

The AVR communicates using an ES8266 module.

The encrypted text is sent to an central server. That could be done via SMTP or an simple HTTP request.

The encrypted answer is downloaded and decrypted in the AVR. the plain text is shown on the display attached to the AVR.
